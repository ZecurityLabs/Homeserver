# Exploring the Intersection of Technology & Security - My Journey into Cloud DevSecOps

Hi, I'm Elias, and you might know me as zefuros. As a passionate developer enthusiast, I am currently on an exciting journey to master the art of deploying secure infrastructures both on-premises and in cloud environments. This isn’t just about learning; it’s about building my future in Cloud DevSecOps roles where security is at the heart of every technological decision.

One of the highlights of this journey for me has been setting up a home server, an endeavor that has not only deepened my technical skills but also ignited my interest in securing digital assets effectively. I’ve learned about firewalls, encryption, and best practices for maintaining a secure network—lessons that have shaped my approach to technology and security.

While I haven't directly contributed to any large-scale projects yet, I am deeply committed to learning from every experience and collaborating with others in the developer community. My goal is to leverage this foundational knowledge into impactful roles where I can apply my understanding of cloud technologies alongside robust cybersecurity measures.

If you’re looking for a dedicated professional who brings enthusiasm and a commitment to security at every level, let's connect! Whether it's discussing innovative ways to enhance cyber defenses or exploring new possibilities in the tech landscape, I am eager to bring value through my ongoing learning and practical experience.
