# Project Overview: Deploying a Secure Home Server with Docker and Kubernetes.

## Introduction
This README document outlines my project aimed at deploying a secure home server using Docker, configuring various services to run securely, and learning about containerization best practices. The focus is on achieving enterprise-grade security for both the infrastructure and the services running within it.

## Phases of the Project

### Phase 1: Deploy a Functional Server
**Objective:** Install the server, configure SSH, install Docker, and necessary dependencies.

**Steps:**
1. **Server Setup:** Purchase and set up a new server.
2. **SSH Configuration:** Enable key-based authentication for secure login.
3. **Docker Installation:** Install Docker on the system.
4. **Dependencies:** Install necessary tools and libraries required by Docker (e.g., `curl`, `git`).

### Phase 2: Secure Local Access
**Objective:** Ensure the server is secured for local access only.

**Steps:**
1. **Change SSH Port:** Modify the SSH port to a non-standard value.
2. **Disable Password Login:** Configure SSH to disable password login.
3. **Root Login Restriction:** Prevent root login via SSH.
4. **SSH Key Management:** Generate and distribute SSH keys for secure access. 
5. **Firewall Configuration:** Set up a firewall that accepts requests only from the local network and ports.

### Phase 3: Secure Service Access with DNS and Reverse Proxy
**Objective:** Enhance security by installing DNS and reverse proxy containers, configuring SSL/TLS certificates, and encrypting traffic between services.

**Steps:**
1. **DNS Container:** Install and configure a Adguard DNS container for internal domain name resolution.
2. **Reverse Proxy:** Set up an Nginx Proxy Manager container as a reverse proxy to manage incoming requests.
3. **SSL/TLS Certificates:** Obtain and configure SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.
4. **Traffic Encryption:** Implement encryption between services (partially done due to ISP limitations).
5. **Access Control:** Restrict access to services to only the local network IP range.

### Phase 4: Learning Container Security Practices
**Objective:** Implement best security practices for running containers.

**Steps:**
1. **Non-Root Users:** Run containers as non-root users.
2. **Disable Root in Containers:** Ensure that root is disabled within the containers.
3. **Elevation of Privileges:** Disable privilege escalation within containers.
4. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities.
5. **Zero Trust Remote Access:** Securely expose the server remotely using ZeroTrust services like Twingate.

### Phase 5: Enhancing Production-Level Security
**Objective:** Use cybersecurity tools to check vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with business security standards and learn how to maintain the enviroment.

**Steps:**
1. **Vulnerability Scanning Tools:** Utilize tools like `Trivy` or `Clair` for regular scanning of the server and containers.
2. **Compliance Checks:** Ensure that all components meet necessary security standards.
3. **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
4. **Incident Response:** Develop and test an incident response plan.
5. **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement monitoring and logging solutions to detect and respond to security incidents.
6. **Regular Updates:** Ensure all software components are regularly updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
7. **Backup and Recovery:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy to ensure data integrity and availability.

### Phase 6: Transition to Kubernetes
**Objective:** Learn about deploying similar infrastructure using Kubernetes clusters.

**Steps:**
1. **Kubernetes Installation:** Set up a Kubernetes cluster on-premises or in the cloud.
2. **Deploy Homeserver on Kubernetes:** Create a Helm chart for deployment and manage it with CI/CD pipelines. 

### Phase 7: Mastery of Automation and Scalability
**Objective:** Automate security tasks, deployments, and scalability across different environments.

**Steps:**
1. **Automation Tools:** Utilize tools like Ansible or Terraform for automating deployment processes.
2. **Network Management:** Create cross-premises and cloud host networks for redundancy.
3. **Automated Backups:** Set up automated volume and image backups with update mechanisms.
4. **Scalability:** Design scalable deployments that can handle increased traffic and users.

## Conclusion
This project involves a multi-phase approach to setting up, securing, and scaling a home server using Docker and related technologies. Each phase builds on the previous one, culminating in a robust, secure infrastructure capable of handling various security practices and scalability needs.
