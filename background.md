# My Journey in Technology and Support

## Background

From an early age, I've been passionate about technology. This interest led me to build my first gaming PC during high school. Little did I know that this hobby would later shape the course of my career. After struggling to enter traditional university programs, I decided to turn my passion into a freelance business. Over the years, I have grown from building custom PCs to becoming a respected figure in the technology support field.

## freelancer Computer and Network Technician

For over ten years, I've worked as a computer and network technician, offering services such as custom PC builds, malware removal, network setup and administration, and consulting for two internet cafe brands. My expertise has also been sought by renowned companies where I've held various positions:

## Technical Consultant at a Major Phone Company

As a technical consultant at a major phone company, my role involved managing software and hardware solutions across multiple media including phone, email, online chat, and handling ecommerce issues. This experience allowed me to develop deep insights into the complexities of customer service and troubleshooting in various digital platforms.

## Advanced Role within the Same Company

In an advanced role at this same company, I managed escalated cases, mentored colleagues through group sessions and one-on-one training, and volunteered at the IT department's front desk during the pandemic to gain insights into helpdesk operations and ticketing systems. This role required not only technical acumen but also strong leadership and communication skills as I guided my team members and interacted with a diverse range of individuals.

## Network Hardware Engineer at a Global Communication Hardware Manufacturer

At another global communication hardware manufacturer, I specialized in network hardware engineering. My responsibilities included handling hardware failures (including triaging issues between software or hardware), coordinating with relevant teams for resolution, managing Return Merchandise Authorizations (RMAs), and providing software support for their web communication platform. This role demanded a high level of technical expertise and the ability to navigate complex global operations seamlessly.

Throughout these roles, I've not only honed my technical skills but also refined my communication and people skills through interactions with a wide range of individuals including end-users, network engineers, and adhering to strict safety protocols like GDPR compliance. My journey in technology support has been both challenging and rewarding, providing me with the opportunity to contribute meaningfully within diverse teams and industries.
